# Linux File System

This course will teach you about the file structure in linux. Learning the linux file system would enable you to troubleshoot problems that you might encounter. Furthermore, it will help you know the ins and outs of your operating system.

Before we start, make sure you are using your linux environment. If you do not know how to install a linux environment, visit Installing Fedora to learn more.

To see the overview of the topic, we can use the cd command to enter the directory. We also need to use the ls command to list the items in the directory.

Try running cd /. cd is the command that will change the directory and / is the root directory.

```
fedora@fedora:~$ cd /
fedora@fedora:~/$ 
```

We can then use the ls command to list the contents of the directory. Try ls.

```
fedora@fedora:~/$ ls
afs     dev     lib         media   proc    sbin    tmp
bin     etc     lib64       mmnt    root    srv     usr
boot    home    lost+found  opt     run     sys     var
fedora@fedora:~/$
```
